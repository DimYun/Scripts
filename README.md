# Scripts
some usefull scripts (python and bash)

There are two scrips for now:

    1. auto_download.py - for download wallpapers form wallheawen.cc
    2. snapbackup.sh - for automate backup files with rsync (cross-platform feature).

A lot of information was taken from ArchWiki and stackoverflow.com (love them)!
